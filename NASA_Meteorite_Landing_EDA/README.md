Hello 👋 and welcome to another Data Science project ⚗️

This one is a special project for me because I absolutely love astronomy and anything to do with the cosmos 🪐🌌☄️🌑⋆⭐💫

In this project I'm going to be doing an exploratory data analysis of meteorite landings from NASA datasets ☄️

I hope to analyze the available data, try to identify patterns and insights and derive information that can be useful in understanding the recent meteorite landings.

Lets go 🚀
