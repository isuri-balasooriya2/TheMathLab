Hello!

This is a simplified project on a movie streaming platform with four tables
- movies
- users
- watch_history
- subscription

The schema design and sql scripts are in this folder.
I have practiced few SQL queries in this project to answer the following questions,
1. Find the most-watched movie
2. Find the average rating by genre
3. Find active users who watched more than 1 movie
4. Rank movies by popularity using RANK()

Cheers :)
