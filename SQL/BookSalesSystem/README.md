Hello!!!

This project is for building a Bookstore Management System, where we track book sales, customers, and payments. For this project I have used DrawSQL app to design our schema and MySQL to create the system. I have uploaded the schema design and the sql script for creating the tables and inserting data into tables in this folder.

the sql commands file contains answers to the below questions,
1. Find total sales per book
2. Find top 3 best selling genres
3. Get the top spending customer
4. Find customers who have bought more than 2 books
5. Check if stock is low (less than 5 books left)
6. Create a stored procedure to check all purchases of a customer.
7. Rank the books based on sales

Cheers :)
